# conversion-rate
In this dataset we have information about the conversion rate of a website. We have some information about the users too, their age, country, whether they are new users, through which source they arrived on the page and how many pages they visited.
The goal is to construct easy Logistic Regression or Random Forest classifiers and compare their metrics based on how well they predict if a user will be converted or not.
